Good morning,

I am emailing in regards to an unemployment insurance account for Merryweather Clinic LLC. (Acct#: 9821670). This account was flagged in our system for review due to an increase in reported employment and wages during quarter 1 of 2021. In order to notate the account with any important economic changes (acquisition, expansion, new worksite or contract, etc), could you provide an explanation for the increase in reported employment and wages?  

Thank you for your time and do reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
